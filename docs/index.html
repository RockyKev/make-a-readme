                    <p>
                        Those new to coding attend to chat developers to see
                        what the best way is to achieve their learning outcome.
                        Maybe it's a bootcamp to attend, a online course to buy,
                        or a youtube training to check out.

                    <p>
                        Experienced developers come to keep in the loop. We see
                        our friends, learn about new technologies, and stay on
                        top of the evolving landscape.

                        Expert developers attend to mentor and advise. Many
                        attend to look for networking opportunities as well - as
                        their years of expertise is very much needed in many
                        organizations and companies.

                        Absolutely! Front-end has grown beyond just being a
                        designer/UX. Front-end developers are making apps,
                        writing code for drones, making video games and setting
                        up database schema.

                    <p>
                        The Front-End community can always use experts in
                        different fields - from robotics, to backend, to
                        engineering, to even gaming.

                        Many opportunities have been created when you put
