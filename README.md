# Spokane Front-End Dev Meetup

This site was cloned from Make A readme, and modified to fit the needs of the group.

## Roadmap

[x] Set up initial foundation
[x] Populate content

## Contributing

Please feel free to submit an issue or pull request. The website is simple
enough to not require a build process. Just open `public/index.html` in a
browser.

If you want [live reloading](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) and have
Node installed, run `$ yarn install && yarn start`. If you have Python and
Docker installed, you can run `$ ./dev start` instead.
